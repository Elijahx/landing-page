# Landing-page mini project

<strong><em>Initial motivations </em></strong>

<p>To develop an entire web page based on an initial design that will allow me to practice new topics such as basic CSS and expand upon old ones like web design related problem solving.</p>

<strong><em>Initial approach</em></strong>

<p>I will approach solving this problem by compartmentalizing it into smaller more palatable chunks by dividing the website into four sections, and for each section developing the html portion followed by the css portion. I also intend on committing frequently and with intention.</p>
