# Landing-page mini project

<strong><em>Initial motivations </em></strong>

<p>To develop an entire web page based on an initial design that will allow me to practice new topics such as basic CSS and expand upon old ones like web design related problem solving.</p>

<strong><em>Initial approach</em></strong>

<p>I will approach solving this problem by compartmentalizing it into smaller more palatable chunks by dividing the website into four sections, and for each section developing the html portion followed by the css portion. I also intend on committing frequently and with intention.</p>

<strong><em>Post self-reflection</em></strong>

<p> This project was a lot messier than anticpated but a lot was learned in the process. Even after having just finished, my approach would be a lot different if I started over knowing what I know now. It was definitely interesting working with the concept of the box model first hand and how that can quickly become box-ception.. . Overall good mini project.

<p> Also, the amount of amazing resources I've stumbled upon from youtube educational content creators to all encompassing online references is amazing.
